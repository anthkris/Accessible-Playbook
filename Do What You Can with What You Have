Rapid development tools have democratized the development of elearning. Whereas, in the past, an instructional designer might have worked with a small team of graphic designers and software developers, many instructional designers today are also developers using particular software. While this enables us to quickly create prototypes and slick designs, it also robs us of the flexibility that we might have had in working with a team of individuals who could design a unique experience that exactly met our users' needs. While nearly all of rapid development tools have made great strides in implementing easy-to-use accessibility features, they aren't perfect and can sometimes seriously limit your design capabilities. While these limitations can frustrate, as designers, it's incumbent on us to do as much as we can, given the tools we have.

To Do
-Use the accessible first methodology
-Know your design tools and their limitations so that you can design around them
-If necessary, be prepared to create alternative versions of your interactions and content

Ask Yourself
-What accessibility features do my tools have?
-Would it be better to create an alternative, less accessible version instead of one version?
