# Accessible-Playbook
Elearning Accessibility Playbook
This project was created for the July Go Design Something Challenge but I hope to see it become something more. As instructional designers and developers, it's our responsibility to take an accessible-first approach and begin to create accessible learning experiences. Through this playbook, I hope that we, as an instructional design community, can begin to confront this issue head on.
