The truth is: information that is not accessible is poorly designed. Even if you could (rightly) assume that you had exactly 0 disabled or impaired people in your target audience, a well-designed project will make it easier for everyone to use and understand your learning experience. Many accessibility advocates turn to captions as an example. Even users who are not deaf or hard of hearing use captions on a regular basis, for example, when they are in a noisy room or when they can't put on earphones. Another example often used is a subway map. Though colors for the various lines can be understood by non-color blind users, a better-designed map that used more than just color to distinguish the subway lines would make the map easier for everyone to use.

To Do
-Every good design process begins by having conversations with stakeholders and users about the performance goals and what they need
-As you design and re-design based on feedback and testing, seek to improve the usability of your experience with every iteration
-Consider universal design and accessibility as a product that serves the bottom line of your organization and opens up your design to a wider range of potential users

Ask Yourself
-How can I improve my design so that it's easier for everyone to use?
-How can a better designed product help the organization meet their performance goals?
-How can I design my product so that it reaches more people?
